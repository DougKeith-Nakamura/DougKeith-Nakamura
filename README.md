- 👋 Hi, I’m Doug Keith-Nakamura (@DougKeith-Nakamura)
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, especially retro 2D platformers! I've been a professional developer since 2001, and am currently an indie Unity/C# 2D developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity 3D development, although 2D is my core passion. 
- 💞️ I’m currently only working on my own projects.
- 📫 You can reach me at d.keithnakamura@gmail.com
